# Logo-Detection
This is a project that I had done for the finals. 
The purpose is to detect various logos and give an output of the basic information of the company that owns the logo/brand. 
The method used in this project is the SIFT method. The train images is stored into a list then are matched with the test images to find the image with 
the most points matched.
